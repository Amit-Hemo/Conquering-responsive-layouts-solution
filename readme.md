# About this repo:  
 - This repo is me trying to complete the course : *conquering responsive layout course* by Kevin Powell, a Frontend mentor and educator.
 - This is for learning purposes for our group to learn about the basics of responsive layouts from zero to flexbox (no css grid in this course) 
 - This can let you learn the course at your own pace, since in the course you need to wait for a new day to come in order to see more content.  
- Basically, there are 21 days and in almost each day we learn new things and they are divided within the directories, each has code examples and explantaions in the **css file**.  

*note:* there are certain days in this course that there is no content at all and cannot be seen here and there are some days with readme content only, you"ll see...
