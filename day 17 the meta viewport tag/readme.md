# The meta viewport tag
 * Some of us always start writing html in vscode with writting '!' -> Enter and we get the template of html directly. You can see that there is a line in the head that is very important for responsive layout :

 ```html
 <p><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"></p>
```

* just remember to **never delete it!**, this line makes sure that our page width is according to the device width and in other words, the page is not responsive without this line.
